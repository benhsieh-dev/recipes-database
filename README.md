## Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with search bar and links to GitHub. After the search, the user can see the ingredients dropped down into the left pane and a photo of the sample meal on the right pane. User can then favorite the recipe on the top right corner that would save the recipe onto a Firebase database. In addition, user can upload photos of recipe attempt and comments at the bottom of screen.
